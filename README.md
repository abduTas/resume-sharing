## Simple MERN Passport Template for a sign-in and sign-up form built with Mongo, Express, ReactJS, Node.js.

For authentication, I am using passport-local strategy and for salting, I am using bcrypt

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Start frontend app with npm start
and backend for the same with nodemon server/serve.js

use 27017 port for mongodb  database

we can sign up login , with protected routes
We can create and update resume details
we can share resume url , which is unprotected since it is to be viewed by non logged in users
